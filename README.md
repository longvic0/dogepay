I've made this button on my spare time on my [CodePen](http://codepen.io/yadomi/pen/EGiKD) and find it cool, so I made a No-jQuery version and decided to share it on GitHub.

You can see it working [here](http://yadomi.github.io/doge-button/) or checkout the [demo.html](https://github.com/yadomi/doge-button/blob/master/demo.html) in this repo.

## Update 2021

This repository has been visited quite often recently because of doge going to the moon. I did this thing back in 2014 and realized now it didn't have a real doge theme. Say no more, I've updated it with very doge theme, much removed zeroclipoard dep and ditched grunt for rollup. To the moon :rocket: !

# Features

 - Show address balance on hover (only with Donate button)
 - Copy address to clipboard when clicking on it, wow
 - Such beautiful
 - Very Locale support (en-US, fr-FR)
